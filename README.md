# Personal Portfolio 
[ed0207.github.io/edPortfolio](https://ed0207.github.io/edPortfolio)

This is my personal project created for the purposes of 

- self-taught learning
- skill demonstration 

### This project is created primarily in React JS with NodeJS

## Framework/ Libraries used:
- React (+ typed, routerDOM)
- Axios

## Highlight:
- Implementing Axios API fetching for automatic Repository updated
- useState to dynamically render graphical component

## To be implemented:
- better font
- update Nav bar with drawer
- proper project cards with horizontal slider
- footer
- photo with effect (?)
- about me section with navigation


## Known glitch/problems:
1. when using useState in the promise.then() callback, function continuously loop itself with the example of continous console.log in the console despite no loop presence, draining up device resource
